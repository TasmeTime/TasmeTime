Growing Love for front-end after avoiding it for many years!

Currently looking to master Javascript, NodeJs for back-end, and The "React framework" for front-end to be specific (React, React Native, NextJs) while working on my personal projects.

Alongside those activities, I turn some of my personal projects into youtube content and try to teach them to other people.

Also, I have hands-one-code experience with ASP.NET MVC, Desktop Applications, and C# in general as they were my gateway to the programming world!
